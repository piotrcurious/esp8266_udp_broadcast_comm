The advantage of this architecture is that it makes the code platform-independent by using fixed-size types and macros to define the data elements. This way, the sender and receiver can have different architectures and still communicate using the same data packet format. The macros also make it easy to add or remove data elements without changing the rest of the code. The serialization and deserialization functions use memcpy to copy the bytes of each data element to and from a byte array. This ensures that the data is not modified or corrupted during transmission. The byte array can then be sent or received as a UDP packet using the WiFiUDP library.
Yes, it will work for any type that can be copied by memcpy. However, you should be careful with floats because they may have different representations on different architectures. For example, some architectures may use single-precision floats (32 bits) while others may use double-precision floats (64 bits). This could cause data loss or corruption if the sender and receiver have different float sizes. A possible solution is to use a fixed-point representation instead of a float, or to use a standard format like IEEE 754 for floats.

prompt:
create Arduino code serializing all elements of example struct together with values and sending them over UDP broadcast packet over wifi. assume code target is esp8266, make sure calls to wifi library are esp8266 compatible. make code checking and keeping connection nonblocking and elegant. create separate header file data_packet.h with needed macros and struct definitions which can be shared with recieving code. finally create corresponding recieving code, casting the data from udp packet back into struct.use strategy of defining macros to create data elements and lists in data_packet.h defining types , names and initialized values. Use those macros to create struct in data_packet.h and code casting variables into data elements into packet in sender.ino code and data elements from the packet to variables in reciever.ino code. Goal is to make it independent from varying default types across different architectures. Explain how this architecture helps keeping the system platform-independent in comments. include examples of modyfying individual data elements in the sender code and reading individual data elements in reciever code.
