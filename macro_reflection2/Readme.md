This architecture helps keeping the system platform-independent by using macros to define the data elements and their types, names and values. This way, the same header file can be shared between the sender and the receiver code, and the data elements can be easily added, removed or modified without changing the code logic. The macros also ensure that the data types are consistent across different architectures, avoiding potential issues with byte order or size. The memcpy function is used to copy the bytes of the data_packet_t object into a byte array for sending and receiving UDP packets, and vice versa. This avoids the need for manual serialization or deserialization of the data elements
