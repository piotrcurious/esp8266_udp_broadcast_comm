This architecture helps keeping the system platform-independent by using macros to define the data elements and their types, names and values. This way, the same header file can be shared between the sender and the receiver code, and the data elements can be easily added, removed or modified without changing the code logic. The macros also ensure that the data types are consistent across different architectures, avoiding potential issues with byte order or size. The memcpy function is used to copy the bytes of the data_packet_t object into a byte array for sending and receiving UDP packets, and vice versa. This avoids the need for manual serialization or deserialization of the data elements

The macros work by using a technique called X-macros. This is a way of using a macro to define a list of items, and then using another macro to apply different operations on each item. For example, the DATA_ELEMENT_LIST macro defines a list of data elements with their types, names and values. Then, the DECLARE_DATA_ELEMENT macro is used to declare each data element as a member of the data_packet_t struct. The same DATA_ELEMENT_LIST macro can be used with different macros to perform different operations on the data elements, such as initializing them, incrementing them, printing them, etc. This avoids having to repeat the same code for each data element, and makes the code more maintainable and scalable.

The macros produce the correct output by using the memcpy function to copy the bytes of the data_packet_t object into a byte array for sending and receiving UDP packets, and vice versa. The memcpy function takes three arguments: a destination pointer, a source pointer and a number of bytes to copy. For example, in the sender code, the memcpy function is used as follows:

```c
memcpy(packet, &data, sizeof(data_packet_t));
```

This copies the bytes of the data object into the packet array. The packet array is then sent as a UDP broadcast packet using the udp.write function. In the receiver code, the memcpy function is used as follows:

```c
memcpy(&data, packet, sizeof(data_packet_t));
```

This copies the bytes of the packet array into the data object. The data object can then be accessed to get the values of the data elements. The memcpy function ensures that the bytes are copied exactly as they are in memory, without any modification or interpretation. This avoids any potential issues with byte order or size that might occur if the data elements were serialized or deserialized manually.
